# 9917103266-HIMANKUR_GOYAL- ZOMENTUM HIRING ASSIGNMENT- UI- CHAT APPLICATION
#Frontend Project- UI for Chat Application

Description:

1)I have designed this UI for chat Application with the help of HTML, CSS, JS using Bootstap Framework.

2)At the Home page,there would be an BLUE ARROW ON RIGHT SIDE,on clicking of which Contact list of all Chats appears from right, it also indicates offline/online status of each contact.     #refer-Screenshot1(Main-Window-RightSide-Arrow)/ScreenShot2(Side-contact-list)

3)You can further open the chatbox of that particular contact by a simple click on that. After which you can start chatting.    #refer-Screenshot3(Chatbox)

4)Keypad appears through chatting is feature rich- all emojis are present you can use any emoji during your chat.

5)Chatboxes for more than one contacts can be open simultaneously means you can append messages for more than one contact at the same time. 
       #refer-Screenshot4(Multiple Chatboxes)

6)You can also hide any of the Chatboxes when there are multiple chatboxes opened.     #refer-Screenshot5(Hide-Chatboxes)

7)All side buttons for emoji and to send the message are present on the either side of typing bar. 

8)One useful feature i provide is that their would be another secion in emoji feature called "Recent used" where all the recently used emoji are stored so you can directly 
  access you favourite and most used emoji faster.     #refer-Screenshot6(Recently-Used-feature-Chatbox)

9)It Perfectly fulfills all the desired mechanism necessary for Chat Application. You can also use it in Mobile    #refer-ScreenShot7(Mobile-View)

10)I have attached all the screenshots for Web view as well as for Mobile view justify above mentioned points.
